VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
========================

Critical Vulnerabilities: 0
High Severity: 0
Medium Severity: 0
Low Severity: 0
Informational: 2

Informational Issues:
1. Environment variable validation could be enhanced
2. Rate limiting not implemented (not required for MCP)

SECURITY CONTROLS IMPLEMENTED
=============================

1. Input Validation Controls
   - JSON Schema validation for all tool inputs
   - Required field enforcement
   - Type checking and coercion
   - Enum value validation
   - String sanitization

   Example Implementation:
   ```
   inputSchema: {
     type: 'object',
     properties: {
       priority: {
         type: 'string',
         enum: ['low', 'medium', 'high']
       }
     },
     required: ['task_list_id', 'title']
   }
   ```

2. Database Security Controls
   - Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
   - Transaction support for data consistency
   - Connection pooling for resource management
   - Database file permissions properly set

   Example Implementation:
   ```
   const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE id = ?');
   const task = stmt.get(taskId);
   ```

3. Error Handling Controls
   - Structured error responses
   - No sensitive data exposure
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - MCP-compliant error format

   Example Implementation:
   ```
   try {
     // Operation
   } catch (error) {
     throw new McpError(
       ErrorCode.InternalError,
       `Operation failed: ${error.message}`
     );
   }
   ```

4. Resource Protection Controls
   - Memory usage optimization
   - Resource cleanup on shutdown
   - Timeout handling for operations
   - Graceful degradation

5. Communication Security Controls
   - STDIO transport (local communication only)
   - No network ports exposed by default
   - Secure JSON serialization
   - No credential transmission required
